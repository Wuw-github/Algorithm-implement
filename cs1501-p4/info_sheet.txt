Additional comments to the grader:

At first, I looked the fourth method as finding the articulation point, therefore I wrote an additional method called hasArticulationPt() which returns true if the graph contains articulation points and false if the graph does not contain articulation points. The method is not used in this program but I just keep it there, wish it does not influence the grading too much.
